# Next Session Prompt

You are continuing refactoring in `D:\src\Edison`.

## Session Objective
- Continue incremental, behavior-preserving refactor.
- Work component-first: refactor one production component, immediately align its tests, and add a functional test if missing.
- Target: 1-3 components per session with < 150 lines changed per component.

## Source of Truth
- Current active work only: `ACTIVE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`.
- Component queue/progress: `REFACTOR_COMPONENT_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Task catalog/backlog by area: `REFACTOR_TASKS.md`.
- Dependency visualization: `docs/architecture/dependency-map.md`.
- Frozen archive: `REFACTOR_PLAN_01.md` and any other historical plan files.

## Context Rules
1. Do not load historical archive files by default.
2. Do not paste or rebuild chronological history into `ACTIVE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`.
3. Keep only the latest completed slice and latest verification in `ACTIVE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`.
4. Use archive files only if the user explicitly asks for historical detail or a previous decision rationale.

## Session Start Checklist (Run BEFORE any code changes)
1. [x] Read `ACTIVE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` for context.
2. [x] Read `REFACTOR_COMPONENT_CHECKLIST.md` to check queue status.
3. [x] If checklist is empty, auto-populate 3-5 components from `REFACTOR_TASKS.md`.
4. [x] Verify `npm run build` passes before starting.
5. [x] Verify `npm test -- --runInBand position-monitor` passes in < 30s.
6. [x] Check if `docs/architecture/dependency-map.md` exists; if missing and >20 components completed, create it.

## Mandatory Session Rules
1. Always update `ACTIVE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` with the latest completed slice and latest verification before session end.
2. Use `REFACTOR_COMPONENT_CHECKLIST.md` as the finite queue of components being refactored.
3. Auto-populate the checklist if the active queue becomes empty.
4. Never do standalone test-cleanup passes.
5. For each chosen component, refactor production code first, then refactor related tests in the same slice.
6. If the component has no functional test, add one in the same slice before marking it complete.
7. Move completed components into the history section of `REFACTOR_COMPONENT_CHECKLIST.md` so the active list shrinks over time.
8. Keep this file short: refresh only `Last Completed` and `Next Step`.
9. Keep user-facing replies short by default unless the user explicitly asks for more detail.
10. Do not maintain a running historical journal here.
11. When touching a file during refactor, replace inline emoji in user-facing logs/messages with shared `ICONS` from `packages/core/src/cli/cli-runtime.ts` instead of keeping literal emoji strings.
12. When you encounter fallback constants or magic numbers, identify what kind they are before leaving them in place:
   - static/runtime constant: extract it into an existing or new constants file
   - strategy/tuning value: move it into config instead of hardcoding it

## Working Order Per Session
1. Run the session start checklist.
2. Pick the next unchecked component from the active queue.
3. Refactor the production component.
4. Refactor the related tests.
5. Add a functional test if missing.
6. Run targeted tests only.
7. Run `npm run build`.
8. Update the handoff, the active plan, and the component checklist.
9. If more than 5 new adapter interfaces were created, update `docs/architecture/dependency-map.md`.

## Last Completed (2026-05-13)
- Completed the cleanup slice for `LiveTicker metric fallback em dash cleanup`, `LiveTicker trend fallback em dash cleanup`, `LiveTicker BTC correlation fallback cleanup`, `Analytics exit price fallback em dash cleanup`, and `Analytics realized PnL fallback em dash cleanup`.
- Normalized the touched `LiveTicker` and `Analytics` fallback rendering onto stable `N/A` wording, removing mojibake-prone em dash placeholders while preserving legitimate numeric zero values instead of treating them as missing data.
- Added focused functional coverage for the cleaned `LiveTicker` and `Analytics` states so the dashboard and analytics views now lock in the placeholder behavior with explicit component-level assertions.
- Verification:
  - `npm --prefix packages/web-client run test -- --runInBand --runTestsByPath src/__tests__/components/dashboard-copy.functional.test.tsx src/__tests__/components/analytics.functional.test.tsx`
  - `npm run build`

## Next Step
- Continue with the next active component from `REFACTOR_COMPONENT_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Start the next finite cleanup batch with `RiskSettings maxLeverage zero-value default guard`.
- Then continue with `RiskSettings maxPositionSize zero-value default guard`, `RiskSettings dailyLossLimit zero-value default guard`, `RiskSettings stopLossPercent zero-value default guard`, and `RiskSettings takeProfitPercent zero-value default guard`.
- Keep the same rule for boundary fixes: preserve legitimate zero values when the UI or state initializer currently falls back via truthiness checks, keep the touched copy ASCII-safe, and add or re-run functional coverage in the same slice so the next cleanup locks the zero-value behavior in place.

## Session End Checklist (Run BEFORE commit)
1. [x] Targeted tests pass.
2. [x] Build passes.
