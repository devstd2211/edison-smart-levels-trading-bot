# Next Session Prompt

You are continuing refactoring in `D:\src\Edison`.

## Session Objective
- Continue incremental, behavior-preserving refactor.
- Prioritize lifecycle/testability and `any` cleanup in `packages/core/src/__tests__/services/*` and related services.

## Source of Truth
- Progress log and active status tracking: `ACTIVE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` (single source of truth).
- Completed historical log: `REFACTOR_PLAN.md` (archived completed track).
- Task catalog/backlog by area: `REFACTOR_TASKS.md`.
- This file (`NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md`) is operational guidance only; do not store full historical progress here.

## Mandatory Session Rules
1. Always update `ACTIVE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` with completed work and verification results before session end.
2. Update `REFACTOR_TASKS.md` only when adding/removing/restructuring backlog tasks.
3. For each test refactor, review the related production service as refactor candidate.
4. If service is a candidate, perform a behavior-preserving service refactor in same session (or add explicit pending item to `ACTIVE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` with reason).
5. Keep this file short: only refresh "Last Completed" and "Next Step".

## Working Order Per Session
1. Pick next target from `ACTIVE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` unchecked/in-progress items.
2. Use `REFACTOR_TASKS.md` for concrete task candidates if decomposition is needed.
3. Execute minimal safe refactor.
4. Run targeted tests for changed area.
5. Record results in `ACTIVE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`.
6. Refresh only brief handoff below.

## Last Completed (2026-03-12)
- Completed testability batch 226 (behavior-preserving lifecycle-test cleanup):
  - added tracked `createServices()` teardown helper for lifecycle-oriented test suites.
  - updated `services/bot-factory.service.test.ts` and `services/bot-factory.error-handling.test.ts` to use tracked real service-state creation with explicit shutdown cleanup.
  - updated `trading-bot.lifecycle.test.ts` to use real `createServices()` state and explicit `bot.start()` / `bot.stop()` assertions.
- Verification:
  - `npm test -- --runInBand packages/core/src/__tests__/services/bot-factory.service.test.ts packages/core/src/__tests__/services/bot-factory.error-handling.test.ts packages/core/src/__tests__/trading-bot.lifecycle.test.ts` -> PASS (3/3 suites, 57/57 tests).
  - `npm run build` -> PASS (`packages/contracts`, `packages/web-server`, `packages/core`, `packages/web-client`).

## Next Step
- Continue the testability stream before reopening adapter cleanup.
- Extend explicit lifecycle teardown and minimal grouped-service construction into the next lifecycle-adjacent suites beyond `bot-factory` / `trading-bot`.
- Keep behavior unchanged, run targeted tests per slice, and log the batch in `ACTIVE_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`.
