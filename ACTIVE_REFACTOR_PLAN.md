# Active Refactor Plan

This file is the active source of truth for current refactor work only.
Historical detail is archived elsewhere and should not be copied here.

## Open Streams
- [ ] Continue lifecycle/testability cleanup in service-adjacent suites that still keep broad managed-context ownership or temporary local service state.
- [ ] Continue replacing broad service-state construction in tests with minimal grouped services or helper-owned tracked state.
- [ ] Continue explicit lifecycle coverage around `createServices()` / `start()` / `stop()` where tests still own teardown directly.
- [ ] Continue adjacent `any` cleanup only when exposed by the current service/test refactor slice.

## Current Focus
- [ ] Prefer remaining service and error-handling suites that still keep direct exported `Managed*Context` types, repeated `ReturnType<typeof createManaged...>` expressions, binder wrappers, fixture-accessor wrappers, or wider-than-needed factory state in scope.

## Immediate Next Candidates
- [ ] Next nearby lifecycle-oriented suites surfaced by `rg` with temporary managed-context locals or helper-accessor wrappers.

## Working Rules
1. Pick the next unchecked item from this file.
2. Apply minimal behavior-preserving changes only.
3. Run targeted tests for the changed slice.
4. Run `npm run build`.
5. Update this file with only the latest completed slice and latest verification.
6. Do not paste chronological history here.

## Latest Completed
- 2026-04-25: completed the next lifecycle/testability narrowing slice across `compound-interest-calculator.service`, `compound-interest-calculator.error-handling`, `exchange-factory.service`, `exchange-factory.error-handling`, `funding-rate-filter.service`, `funding-rate-filter.error-handling`, `exit-type-detector.service`, `exit-type-detector.service.error-handling`, `graceful-shutdown.service`, `graceful-shutdown.error-handling`, `tick-delta-analyzer.service`, `tick-delta-analyzer.error-handling`, `tf-alignment.service`, `tf-alignment.error-handling`, `trading-journal.service`, `trading-journal.error-handling`, `take-profit-manager.service`, `take-profit-manager.error-handling`, `websocket-authentication.service`, and `websocket-authentication.error-handling`.
- Narrowed another 20-suite batch of managed test state by replacing local `ReturnType<typeof createManaged...>` aliases and temporary managed-context locals with existing helper-exported runtime/state contracts, keeping suite ownership closer to helper-defined boundaries.
- Reviewed adjacent production surfaces around compound interest sizing, exchange construction, funding-rate gating, exit classification, graceful shutdown, tick delta analysis, timeframe alignment, trading journal persistence, take-profit tracking, and websocket auth; no small safe production refactor was required in this slice.

## Latest Verification

- 2026-04-25: `npm run build` PASS
